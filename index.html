           <p>
               John was born and raised for the better half of his childhood in the Bay Area of Northern California.
               He spent a sizeable portion of his youth moving frequently, giving him a diverse background and an awareness of different cultures.
               He is a gifted artist who enjoys anything that can be considered an adventure, whether it be of the body or of the mind.
               With a knack for technology and a propensity to create, he decided to put his intuitive skills to good use and receive the training required to contribute to society as a software engineer. 
               When not designing websites, you can find John writing and recording music, journaling, working on his book, or getting some sunlight.
               He is available for freelance work at the contact information provided below.
